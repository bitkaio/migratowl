## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2026-04-18

### Added

- **Raw sandbox mode** (`MIGRATOWL_SANDBOX_MODE=raw`) — runs on any Kubernetes cluster without
  the agent-sandbox controller or CRDs. Migratowl manages ephemeral pods directly via the
  Kubernetes API. Intended for CI environments (kind, EKS, GKE) where CRD installation is not
  practical. Controlled by three new settings: `MIGRATOWL_SANDBOX_MODE`, `MIGRATOWL_SANDBOX_IMAGE`
  (default `python:3.12-slim`), and `MIGRATOWL_SANDBOX_BLOCK_NETWORK` (default `true`; note that
  kind's default CNI kindnet does not enforce NetworkPolicy).
- **`k8s/rbac-raw.yaml`** — RBAC manifest for raw mode; grants direct Pod create/delete and
  NetworkPolicy create/delete instead of the Sandbox CR verbs used by agent-sandbox mode.
- **Migratowl self-scan workflow** (`.github/workflows/migratowl-scan.yml`) — Migratowl scans its
  own dependencies on `workflow_dispatch` (full scan) and on Dependabot PRs (targeted single-dep
  scan). Spins up a kind cluster in raw mode, starts an ephemeral Migratowl server, and polls for
  completion with a 5-minute initial wait and a 1-hour wall-clock deadline.
- **`docs/examples/ci-only.yml`** — drop-in GitHub Actions workflow for projects that want
  Migratowl scans without running a persistent server; self-contained, requires only
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` as a repository secret.
- **`docs/examples/with-migratowl-server.yml`** — renamed from `dependabot-scan.yml`; triggers an
  existing Migratowl deployment via webhook.

### Changed

- `docs/examples/dependabot-scan.yml` renamed to `docs/examples/with-migratowl-server.yml` for
  clarity.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **GitLab support** — `git_provider: "gitlab"` is now a valid value on `POST /webhook`.
  Migratowl posts a note (comment) on the merge request and sets GitLab commit statuses
  (`running` → `success` / `failed`) using the GitLab REST API v4 (`migratowl/git/gitlab.py`).
  Self-hosted instances are supported via `GITLAB_API_URL`.
- **`commit_sha` field on `POST /webhook`** — when provided alongside `pr_number`, Migratowl
  posts a `pending` / `running` commit status at scan start and updates it to `success` or
  `failure` / `error` when the scan completes or fails.
- **PR/MR notification system** (`migratowl/git/notify.py`) — three lifecycle hooks wired into
  the scan background task: `notify_pr_start` (pending status), `notify_pr_done` (comment +
  final status), `notify_pr_failed` (error status). All failures are logged and swallowed so a
  notification error never aborts a scan.
- **PR comment formatter** (`migratowl/git/formatter.py`) — renders a `ScanAnalysisReport` as
  a markdown table (breaking packages first, safe packages after) with confidence percentages and
  fix suggestions; includes a collapsible `<details>` block for skipped packages and a scan
  duration footer.
- **`GitHubClient`** (`migratowl/git/github.py`) — thin async wrapper around the GitHub REST API
  (`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{pr}/comments`, `POST .../statuses/{sha}`); supports
  GitHub Enterprise Server via `GITHUB_API_URL` / `github_api_url`.
- **GitHub Actions example workflow** (`docs/examples/dependabot-scan.yml`) — drop-in workflow
  that triggers Migratowl on every Dependabot PR; fires on `pull_request` events, posts the repo
  URL, branch, PR number, and commit SHA to the webhook endpoint.
- **`git_provider` validated as a literal** — `ScanWebhookPayload.git_provider` is now typed
  `Literal["github", "gitlab"]` (previously an unvalidated `str`), so invalid values are rejected
  at webhook ingestion time.
- **`GITLAB_TOKEN` / `GITLAB_API_URL` config** — new settings read from standard env vars
  (`GITLAB_TOKEN`, `GITLAB_API_URL`) with `MIGRATOWL_` prefix aliases.
- **`GITHUB_API_URL` config** — new setting (default `https://api.github.com`) to support GitHub
  Enterprise Server without code changes.
- **`mode` field on `POST /webhook`** — controls how the latest available version is resolved
  when checking for outdated dependencies. `"normal"` (default) ignores the constraint operator
  and compares the bare version against the globally highest published version, surfacing
  major-version bumps such as `express 4.x → 5.x` that the registry's own `latest` tag would
  otherwise hide. `"safe"` respects the declared semver constraint (e.g. `^4.21.2` only flags a
  newer version if one exists within `>=4.21.2,<5.0.0`).
- **`include_prerelease` field on `POST /webhook`** — when `true`, pre-release versions
  (alpha, beta, RC, dev) are included when determining the latest available version. Defaults to
  `false`; orthogonal to `mode` and can be combined with either value.
- **Per-ecosystem all-versions registry queries** — `check_outdated_deps` now fetches the full
  published version list from each registry rather than relying on a single "latest" pointer:
  - **npm**: reads `versions` object keys from the packument (already fetched, no extra call)
  - **PyPI**: reads `releases` dict keys from the package JSON (already fetched, no extra call)
  - **crates.io**: new call to `/api/v1/crates/{name}/versions`; yanked versions are excluded
  - **Go module proxy**: switched from `/@latest` (JSON) to `/@v/list` (newline-separated text)
    to obtain the full version history
  - **Maven Central**: query extended with `core=gav&rows=100` to retrieve all published versions
    instead of the single `latestVersion` field
- **`_constraint_to_specifier()` helper** — parses npm/Cargo `^`/`~` operators and Python-style
  range specifiers into a `packaging.specifiers.SpecifierSet` for constraint-aware filtering;
  handles the `0.x` and `0.0.x` special cases of caret semantics
- **`_max_version()` helper** — picks the highest version from a list with optional pre-release
  filtering using `packaging.version.Version.is_prerelease`
- **`CheckOptions` dataclass** — internal configuration object carrying `mode` and
  `include_prerelease`; threaded from the webhook payload through the agent factory and tool
  factory to every per-ecosystem registry query function

- **`check_deps` field on `POST /webhook`** — allowlist counterpart to `exclude_deps`. When
  non-empty, only the listed dependency names are checked; all other dependencies are ignored.
  Defaults to `[]` (check everything). Useful for targeted scans when only a specific subset of
  dependencies is of interest.

### Fixed

- Standardized casing of "Migratowl" (previously inconsistently written as "MigratOwl") across
  all source files, documentation, and comments

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-01

Initial release.

### Added

- **LangGraph agent** — stateful migration agent built on deepagents and LangGraph, exposed via
  `langgraph.json` for compatibility with deep-agents-ui; Kubernetes sandbox created lazily on
  first invocation with thread-safe double-checked locking and `atexit` cleanup
- **Langfuse session injection** — `session_graph.py` patches `ainvoke`, `astream`, and
  `astream_events` in-place to map LangGraph Server `thread_id` to Langfuse `langfuse_session_id`
  without breaking `isinstance(graph, Pregel)` validation
- **FastAPI webhook** — `POST /scan` endpoint accepts `ScanWebhookPayload`, creates a background
  job, and returns a job ID immediately; job status queryable via `GET /jobs/{id}`;
  single-concurrent-scan semaphore prevents resource exhaustion
- **Language detection tool** — identifies the ecosystem (Python, Go, Java, Node.js) from manifest
  files present in the cloned repository inside the K8s sandbox
- **Dependency scanning tool** — parses manifest files per ecosystem
  (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `package.json`),
  queries registries for latest versions, and reports outdated dependencies with severity
- **Registry query tools** — PyPI, Go module proxy, Maven Central, and npm registry clients for
  fetching current package versions and changelogs
- **Changelog fetching tool** — retrieves release notes for a dependency version from its upstream
  source to populate migration context in analysis reports
- **Update dependencies tool** — applies version updates directly to manifest files inside the
  sandbox using ecosystem-specific patch commands; supports multi-manifest repositories
- **validate_project tool** — runs the project's build and test suite inside the sandbox after
  applying updates; auto-detects Maven vs Gradle for Java, pip extras for Python tests;
  populates `confidence` field in `ScanAnalysisReport`
- **Java ecosystem support** — `pom.xml` and `build.gradle` parsers; Maven versions plugin and
  Gradle manifest patch for version updates; Maven Central registry queries; Maven and Gradle
  build/test validation with auto-detection
- **Go ecosystem support** — `go.mod` parser; `go get` update commands; Go module proxy registry
  queries; `go build` and `go test` validation
- **Python ecosystem support** — `requirements.txt` and `pyproject.toml` parsers; pip/uv update
  commands; PyPI registry queries; pytest validation with test extras auto-detection
- **Package analyzer subagent** — dedicated sub-agent for deep per-package upgrade analysis,
  improving confidence scoring and change summarisation
- **Pydantic schemas** — `Ecosystem`, `DependencyInfo`, `ScanAnalysisReport`, `JobState`,
  `JobStatus`, `ScanWebhookPayload`; `ScanAnalysisReport` includes breaking change extraction
  and outdated dependency cap
- **Centralized configuration** — `pydantic-settings`-based `Settings` with `.env` support;
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `LANGFUSE_*`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `K8S_*` and HTTP client tuning knobs
- **Kubernetes sandbox** — langchain-kubernetes `KubernetesProvider` in `agent-sandbox` mode;
  runtime server (`k8s/runtime/`) provides Python 3, Node.js 22, Go 1.23, Rust in a
  hardened non-root container; deny-all NetworkPolicy; RBAC service account for the agent pod
- **Sandbox router** — lightweight FastAPI reverse proxy (`k8s/sandbox-router/`) routing agent
  requests to the correct sandbox pod; hash-verified pip installation
- **Observability** — Langfuse tracing on every agent invocation; OpenAI model support alongside
  Anthropic for model flexibility
